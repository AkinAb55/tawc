/* Helper: turn the existing in-binary `tawc_io_step` output into one cleat
 * test per [ok ]/[FAIL] line.
 *
 * The testhost binary already prints `  [ok ] LABEL` / `  [FAIL] LABEL` for
 * each individual check (~80+ across phase-0 + phase-1). Re-running the
 * testhost per check would be silly; instead each test file's
 * `register_dynamic_tests` block runs the testhost ONCE, parses the output,
 * and registers one cleat test per parsed step under its module.
 *
 * Each registered test:
 *   - PASS if its line was `[ok ]`
 *   - FAIL with the surrounding kv-context lines if it was `[FAIL]`
 *
 * If the testhost itself fails to exec or exits with a status mismatch
 * (process-level), an extra problem-test under that module surfaces it
 * as a regular failure in the report.
 *
 * cleat's test_module_from_file() doesn't apply here -- we pass `module`
 * explicitly. By convention, use the file's basename without `test_` /
 * `.c` (e.g. `phase0` for `tests/handler/test_phase0.c`).
